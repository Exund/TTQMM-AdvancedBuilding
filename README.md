# TTQMM-AdvancedBuilding
Advanced Building for TerraTech (move/rotate/scale blocks).
To activate, add a RR Hadamard Superposer block on your tech and scroll click on any block.

The mod also adds a text search to the inventory, a block pipette, physics centers display (COM, COT, COL) and keyboard controls to change selected block category.

Keybindings are configurable in the game options.
